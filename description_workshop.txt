A wheelchair mod that I made because my friends said I couldn't play a merman in our next playthrough and we settled on me being wheelchair bound

I wanted a lot more features that actually made being in a wheelchair viable to play than preexisting mods didn't offer

Still in the early stages, but the core mechanics of how the wheelchairs work is in the mod, and is multiplayer compatible for obvious reasons
