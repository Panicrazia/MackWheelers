This is a wheelchair mod, originally inspired by [TerraWheelchair by MoebiusMeow](https://github.com/MoebiusMeow/TerraWheelchair), now though the only thing left is the original (and very well made) wheelchair sprite

I made this because my friends wouldnt let me play as a merman and have gills and no lungs durring our next terraria playthrough, so we settled on me being wheelchair bound instead

Soon I realized that I would have to essentially rebuild the mod from the ground up, to fundamentally change the wheelchair from a projectile into a mount
